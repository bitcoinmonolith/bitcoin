# Bitcoin

Experimental Bitcoin node and client. Still a work in progress, not ready for real use. Stuff will break. Donâ€™t connect
to mainnet or use real funds.

For learning, hacking, or just messing around (for now).

Fully made in Deno and TypeScript.

Optimizes of storage using a few GB of disk space while not sacrificing performance.

## Notes

- The whole codebase uses wire format internally, so there is no `.reverse()` or `.toReversed()` in the whole codebase
  except for console logging.
